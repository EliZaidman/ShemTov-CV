Warriors Merge is a prototype described in Dor Shem Tov’s portfolio, focusing on System-driven mobile battler built around inventory merge decisions and base-versus-base combat.

## My Role

- Designed the **core game loop** and player progression

- Iterated on balance based on playtests and internal feedback  
- Documented the design for future iteration

## Highlights

- Clear, readable structure for new players  
- Tight focus on a single strong mechanic  
- Built to support rapid iteration and testing

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Scoping the experience**  
  Kept the design lean to avoid feature creep and protect the main mechanic.

- **Communicating feedback**  
  Used visual, audio, and timing cues to make outcomes easy to understand.

## Tech Stack

- Mobile systems design, combat pacing, meta-progression tuning
