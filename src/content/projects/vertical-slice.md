Vertical Slice was created for **Global Game Jam 2023**, with the goal of building a tiny but complete “slice” of a polished experience.

## My Role

- Designed the core **game experience** and player flow  
- Shaped the pacing of encounters and moment-to-moment feedback  
- Helped keep scope small enough to ship a stable jam build  
- Collaborated closely with the team to align on priorities

## Highlights

- A complete, understandable gameplay loop in only 48 hours  
- Strong clarity and feedback for first-time players  
- Minimal bugs thanks to tight scope and a focused design

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Finishing a complete slice**  
  Cut any feature that did not support the core loop or that risked stability.

- **Fast feedback iteration**  
  Tuned timing, movement, and responsiveness continuously based on quick playtests.

## Tech Stack

- Unity  
- 2D gameplay systems  
- Jam-ready state architecture
