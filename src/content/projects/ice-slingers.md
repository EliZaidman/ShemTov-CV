Ice Slingers is a prototype described in Dor Shem Tov’s portfolio, focusing on Physics-focused slingshot prototype exploring impact, readability, and simple fail states for mobile.

## My Role

- Designed the **core game loop** and player progression  
- Defined win/fail conditions and feedback systems  
- Iterated on balance based on playtests and internal feedback  
- Documented the design for future iteration

## Highlights

- Tight focus on a single strong mechanic  
- Built to support rapid iteration and testing

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Scoping the experience**  
  Kept the design lean to avoid feature creep and protect the main mechanic.

- **Communicating feedback**  
  Used visual, audio, and timing cues to make outcomes easy to understand.

## Tech Stack

- Physics-based core loop, onboarding and clarity tuning
